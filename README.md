# 🎶 Rock Your Decades – Guess the Song  

## Description
Rock Your Decades is a Python-based game built with Tkinter where players guess the original English song titles from their Hindi translations. The game starts with a timer of 30 seconds, and each correct guess increases your score and adds bonus time, while wrong guesses reduce your remaining time. It uses Google Translate (via `googletrans`) to generate Hindi translations, a large song list stored in `Songs.txt`, and a leaderboard saved in `scores.csv` to keep track of scores.  

**## Features**  
- 🕹️ Fun and interactive Tkinter-based UI  
- ⏳ Countdown timer with bonus/penalty mechanics  
- 🌐 Google Translate integration for Hindi translations  
- 🎵 100+ songs provided in `Songs.txt`  
- 🏆 Leaderboard to save and view high scores
